Invite - [Around the Clock](https://discord.gg/nk69jVbJMP)

Around the Clock is a server that focuses on studying with others. Join others to share and get some work done. We are available to help and push you to success. I create some bots with Python that help serve the various functions in the Discord. Most of my work is done and hosted on [repl.it](https://repl.it/~) - [(profile)](https://repl.it/@JavaDaBear). I mainly work in Python, but started exploring HTML and CSS. To be honest, I think I started coding with Skript in Minecraft üòÖ.
